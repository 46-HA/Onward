Onward: A WIP Arduino Robot YSWS

Problems:

- Sponsors/Money
- Support
- Framework

# **Outline:**

Users would submit a schematic and design for a robot of their choosing. The design has to include:

 

- Arduino Nano
- Motor
- 3D print files for a case (would act like a chassis)

Users can ask for custom components or use a wide list of already supported items. The list is an example of what could be available

 

- Motor
- Camera
- Bluetooth module
- Sensors
- Propellers
- Accelerometer/gyroscope
- Servo Motors
- Infrared sensor

Project ideas can be anything.
